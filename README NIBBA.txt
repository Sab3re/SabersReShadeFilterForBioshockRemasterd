Incase you didn't read the instructions in the description, or didn't understand it. Here are the steps to adding the shaders!

THIS IS FOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE RESHADE! IF YOU DO HAVE IT THEN YOU CAN SKIP THE INSTALATION!
1. Paste this link in your preferd browser, and download reshade-- https://reshade.me/

2. Open reshade and click the button that says "click here to select a game and manage it's ReShade installation"

3. LOTS of .exe files might show up, depending on how mush shit you have. Wait for it to get done, and select "BioshockHD.exe"

4. A new memu should show up, select the option that says "Direct3D 10/11/12" and check all of the filters that you want, or spam the ok button like you have ADHD.

5. By this point reshade should be installed, so now you can get to the fun part.



AND NOW FOR THE REASON YOU DOWNLOADED THIS SHIT!

Open steam, right click on bioshock or bioshock remasterd (it's the same thing), 
hover your cursor over the "manage" option and click "browse local files", open the "Build" folder then open the "Final" folder, now you just drag & drop the shader.
